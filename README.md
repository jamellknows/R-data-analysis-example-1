# R Data Analytics Script

This R script performs basic data analytics using synthetic data, leveraging the power of `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyr` packages. It generates synthetic data for two groups, performs data wrangling and descriptive statistics using `dplyr` and `tidyr`, creates visualizations using `ggplot2`, and saves both the data and plots to files.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have R installed on your machine along with the required packages. You can install the dependencies by running the following commands in the R console:

```R
if (!require("dplyr")) install.packages("dplyr")
if (!require("ggplot2")) install.packages("ggplot2")
if (!require("tidyr")) install.packages("tidyr")
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/r-data-analytics-script.git
cd r-data-analytics-script
Run the script:

R
Copy code
source("data_analytics_script.R")
Check the generated output files in the same directory:

distribution_plot.png: Image file containing the distribution plot.
boxplot_comparison.png: Image file containing the boxplot for group comparison.
data_analysis_results.csv: CSV file containing the results of the data analysis.
Output Files
1. Distribution Plot

This plot illustrates the distribution of data for Group A and Group B.

2. Boxplot Comparison

The boxplot provides a visual comparison between the two groups.

3. Data Analysis Results
data_analysis_results.csv

The CSV file contains the results of the data analysis, including the synthetic data and descriptive statistics.
